 * 
 * Instructions: To handle the modules in your operating system, you will need to implement a stack. 
 * The stack will be for holding the modules in the order in which they have to be compiled.
 * You may use any data structure, singly-linked list, etc. You may NOT use the Java Stack Class. 
 * However, your program must be able to handle the three stack functions; push, pop, and peek. 
 * 
 * The final program should be able to take a list of data items and generate a stack. 
 * You are free to specify the data type of the items. 
 * However, keep in mind that these items will represent your operating system modules
 * You can choose to have the data type as strings
 * (Module A, Module B, etc. …), characters (A, B, C…) or integers (1, 2,3…).
